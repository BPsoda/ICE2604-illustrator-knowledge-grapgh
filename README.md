## Project Design
&emsp;&emsp;There are numerous awesome illustrators and delicate illustrations on the internet.But have you ever thought how they are related to each other?  
&emsp;&emsp;Our project aims to find and visualizing the relationship between each illustrator and illustration, by the means of **illustrator map** and **illustration ranking & trending**.  
### Illustrator map
&emsp;&emsp;By static the tags of one illustrator's works and turn it to a vector, we can represent the style of an author as a vector. Plotting it one a graph and add following relationship as edges, we get the illustrator map.
